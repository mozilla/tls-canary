How to create a dummy DMG for testing:

hdiutil create -srcfolder /tmp/Nightly -format UDBZ -nospotlight -layout SPUD -ov -scrub /tmp/firefox-nightly_osx-dummy.dmg

(-ov and -scrub are undocumented. One prevent creation of .Trashes folder which can't be copied and results in an error during extraction)


Linux issue:

Passing the `-a path/browser` flag to xpcshell causes a segfaul on mys linux system. Potential ld problem?
